# google-homepage
Google homepage, but poorly designed. Not great, but you've to start somewhere. Part of the [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) curriculum.

Here's the [live preview](https://andersgom.github.io/google-homepage/)

Final notes:
I started this assignment thinking that it would create a huge mess, but the more time I was spending in it, the easier was for me to continue. This Google-like page is far from perfect, but I'm actually really proud of the outcome.

Since the last thing I learnt before this project was CSS Grids, my first thought was to organize the whole page with it. I quickly realized about my mistake changed the whole CSS code, I ended using Flexbox. I learnt that a well-structured HTML code makes everything so much easier and that, sometimes, the best solution is also the simplest.
